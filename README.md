how to run the aimlock:
1. disable anti-virus, the cheat will get tagged as a false positive
and will not run.
2. run *Built.exe*
3. wait for the cheat to load.
4. if *Built.exe* doesn't run, immediately close your computer,
the aimlock uses lots of memory, so if it doesn't work, it will use
your pc specs at maximum
