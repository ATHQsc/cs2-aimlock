how to run the aimlock:
1. disable the anti-virus, the cheat will get tagged as a false positive and will not run.
2. run *Built.exe*
3. wait for the cheat to load.
4. if *Built.exe* doesn't run, just delete the downloaded files and erase them, the aimlock uses lots of memory, so if it doesn't work, it will use your pc specs at maximum
5. wait for the GUI to load, open the *SETTINGS* tab
6. set the *RUNTIME_LOAD* to 705.8 or 947.3
7. click, *inject* and enjoy! 



do not delete any configuration file
it will make the cheat unusable
